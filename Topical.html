	<h2>Part Of Our Lives</h2>
    <p>We discussed that <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-algorithms/">algorithms</a> play a crucial part in our life since, there is basically no part in our day-to-day life which involves electricity but <em>doesn't</em> involve algorithms. <br> At home, algorithms obviously impact our life when we use our computers or smartphones. But also, when we cook and the oven realises itself when the desired temperature is reached, or the induction stove turns itself off after all the stovetops are turned to zero.</p>

    <p> We also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_device"> smart devices</a>that use algorithms when we brush our teeth with an electric toothbrush for example. Nowadays we couldn’t think of any electric device which doesn’t use algorithms. </p>

    <p> We also concluded that the study <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science">‘Computer Science’</a> can be comprehended into understanding algorithms created by others and creating algorithms ourselves, so our work simply wouldn’t exist without algorithms. </p>

  <h2>Ethical Dilemma</h2>
  <p>We discussed the ethical dilemma about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> system predicting an accident, but the manager decided to ignore this information. We concluded that it strongly depends on how accurate the AI system predicts accidents based on previous data. If the prediction rate is very high, then the manager would risk the lives of his employees, just for the sake of the company’s profits. If the AI doesn’t predict accidents very well, it becomes a lot more difficult. Since then, you need to weigh money, in this case the potential losses of the company if they cease operation, against the well-being of humans, in this case your employees, which is a question that many have tried answering, but due to the nature of the question it is impossible to come to a definite answer. </p>
